OpenSURF is a clean, unintrusive SURF feature extraction library written in C++ with OpenCV.

The OpenSURF library was originally written in Visual Studio 2005, although a linux compatible makefile has been contributed and is available in the SVN directory.

Should you wish to contribute to the project please email your Google Code id and I will arrange SVN access.
